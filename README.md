# Module 1 - First Challenge

For this challenge I made various revisions to the website Horiseon. The main purpose of the revisions were to make the website more accesible to people with various degrees of disabilities. In the following paragraphs I will explain the format and a few of the edits I made to the newly upgraded website. Enjoy!

## Website Sections

To ensure website accessibility it is crucial that the code is nicely organized, structured; it is also important that images have alt text, the color of the page has contrasting colors, etc. 

- The new website changes constitute of the following:

1. The website has been divided into three main sections - header, body, footer - 

2. The header contains the name of the firm on the left side, and a new navigation menu on the right side. The new menu gives a better idea of the overall purpose of the website. The new menu contains the following sections: "About Us", "Consulting Services", and "Service Benefits". 

3. The body of the website contains the sections mentioed in the heaer - "About Us", "Consulting Services", and "Benefits of Service" - and the content goes in detail. On the html, and css you will notice that each section is neatly organized per the comments on each sections, and respecting the header number cronollogy. 

4. Lastly, the end of the page has the footer.
